
This C# winforms application allow to view/extract most resources used by the game ThemePark (1994).

USAGE : start the application, go to File > Set Game Location Folder..., choose folder where game is installed.

HMP files (music) cannot be read directly from application. However they can be exported, they read in external application (like FooBar2000 with appropriate plugin)

Original files (data) are not included with this project (since they are still copyrighted), you can get them from original CD / floppy or buy the game online.
